# Light Learning for Object Recognition & Tracking

## Having an AI that learned its way the way we do.

We humans, need a sample or two of an image, to learn a new object. Then, we’re able to recognize it in the wild, with little to no effort, after a brief consolidation period that regularly consists of light repetition, plus some trial and error.

### Main goals
* Learning from one (or just a few) sketch or sample
* Learn progressively through trial and error
* Minimum energy consumption when recognizing learned objects

### Context or Common Sense
Laws of physics - Gravity basically
3 Dimensionality
We map objects with a 3D dimensionality in mind. We “have” the “ability” to learn from a 2d sketch, and recognize a real 3d object instance (i.e. a Cow) when seen (i.e. in the Zoo).

### Stereoscopic vision
Looks like a cornerstone to abstract an object from its context, to be recognized in isolation. There’s a say that, thru Deep Learning training, recognizing a Cow, posing in a Beach, requires samples provided at training time. But if context is removed, and focusing can be a killer feature here, learning to recognize a Cow in whatever Context, can become a no-brainer.

> On a second though, our ability to recognize from stills (imprinted photos) that are kind of flattened (2d) from their original form, shows us that learnt context may be powerfull enough to replace stereoscopic vision when not available.

### Graph
we can recognize a plant, or a flower, without knowing the species. Maybe Light Learning refers to Generalized or Simple, and Deep Learning, refers to Specialized, and they’re complementary

### Attribute Encoding approach
Describe from Attributes (is it Hard or Soft?), and complement with an Image or Two of the target. This technique looks to replace learning from many examples, in favor of deriving from what was learned (in a human-like fashion)

## Traffic Sign recognition
To test our hypothesis, we'll pick this challenge, that's a step on a much bigger one: Augmented Driving.

### Augmented Driving
The reason behind it, is to serve as a step for Autonomous Driving. Closing the trust gap that blocks us from delegating a life or death task to a machine. By using Augmentation to show what the computer sees, considers, but leaving the human in the loop, to make decisions with the inforation and hints that the computer provides in real time.

Scenarios:
* Traffic Sign recog
* Pedestrians
* Abide regulations while driving
* Surroundings
* Short, Mid, and Long term
* Anticipate actions (ie. Lights about to turn Red)
